# How will we improve if we could have more time
Our stretch goal was to build a chatbot to help the users communicate with each others. We have already set up the basic back-end. The idea is to use the PATCH method to update the text message and store them in an array. Later on, in front-end, we will filter the message by using userID and display them based on the time when the message is sent.
